# Notion - A class-based PowerShell module for interacting with Notion

(Notion)[https://notion.com], is an online knowledge management tool in which you can structure your requirements yourself or be inspired by countless templates and formats. Unfortunately, there was no PowerShell module that offers the full power of the API.

In order to ensure the smoothest possible interaction with the API, the specifications were implemented with PowerShell classes. This means that classes are used in the background for all cmdlets. You can also create your own Notion objects directly using the classes provided.

## Prerequisites

- PowerShell 7.0 or higher
- 
## Getting started

To get started either:

- Install from the PowerShell Gallery using PowerShellGet by running the
  following command:

```PowerShell

```
